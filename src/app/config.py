"""Configuration constants for the application.

This module stores global constants and configuration settings used by the
visualization app (grid bounds, resolution, default colors, etc.). Keep
configuration simple and import values where needed.

Example:
        from src.app.config import TR_MIN, TR_MAX

Note: Prefer keeping configuration immutable at runtime.
